    <p>
      Wrapping the text around an image is quite attractive for any kind of
      website. Now the image can be in different shapes or the basic square
      shape. We have to wrap that image with the text. By using HTML and CSS
      wrapping an image with the text is possible and there are many ways to do
      so because the shape of any image is not constant. Wrapping a text means
      adjusting/wrapping text around an image. In HTML, we can either align the
      image on the right side of the text, or to the left, or to the center. In
      CSS, besides these we can also insert the images in a circle or rectangle,
      etc. and can wrap a text around it. You can also use CSS shape-outside
      Property depending on the shape of your image. Below examples illustrate
      the above approach: Example 1: In this example, the image is floating
      right side of the screen and the text is wrapping the image. In this
      example, we don’t require shape-outside property because the shape image
      is usual(square).
